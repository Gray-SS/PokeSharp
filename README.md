# Pok√©Sharp (Educational Purpose Only)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a **non-commercial, educational clone** of the original Pok√©mon games, developed purely to demonstrate how such a game can be implemented from scratch using C#.

It is **not affiliated with Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pok√©mon Company**, and is not intended for commercial distribution or public gameplay.

Some **original assets** from the Pok√©mon games are used **strictly for educational purposes only**, and will be removed if legally required.
